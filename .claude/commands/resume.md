# Resume Session

You are resuming a development session. Please help me get back up to speed by:

1. **Check the TODO list** - Review any pending or in-progress tasks to understand what was being worked on
2. **Check git status** - See what branch we're on and if there are any uncommitted changes
3. **Review recent commits** - Look at the last 3-5 commits to understand recent work
4. **Check for any README or project documentation** - Look for project context files
5. **Summarize the current state** - Based on all the above, provide:
   - What was completed in the last session
   - What's currently in progress
   - What are the next steps
   - Any important context I should know

After your summary, ask me if I want to:
- Continue with the next pending task
- Review a specific area
- Start something new
