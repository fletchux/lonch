# Task List: Collaboration & Permissions - Phase 1A (Core Permissions MVP)

**Based on PRD:** `0003-prd-collaboration-permissions.md`
**Feature:** Collaboration & Permissions - Phase 1A (Simpler MVP)
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Not Started

**Phase 1A Scope:** Basic role-based permissions (Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer) with project invitation system and activity logging. No group distinction in this phase - all collaborators see the same project data.
