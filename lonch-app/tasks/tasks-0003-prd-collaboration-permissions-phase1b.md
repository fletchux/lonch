### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test` to run all tests with Vitest
- Phase 1A foundation provides: roles (Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer), invitation system, activity logs, members UI
- Phase 1B adds the group layer on top of existing role-based permissions
- Groups are hardcoded: "consulting" and "client" (no dynamic group creation)

**Phase 1B Breakdown:**
- 8 parent tasks
- 72 sub-tasks total
- Builds directly on Phase 1A foundation
- Adds dual-group architecture with document visibility controls

**Next Step:** Follow `process-task-list.md` workflow - create feature branch, implement one sub-task at a time, mark completed, commit after each parent task completion.
