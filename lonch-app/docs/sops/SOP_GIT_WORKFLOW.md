# SOP: Git & Commit Conventions

**Purpose:** Maintain clean, meaningful git history that tells the story of our codebase.

**When to use:** Every time you commit code. Every single time.

**Time:** 2-5 minutes per commit (planning what to say)

---

## üìã TL;DR

```bash
1. Branch naming: feature/description OR bug/XX-description
2. Commit when: Logical unit complete + ALL tests passing
3. Commit message: Type + summary + details + footer
4. Always include Claude Code footer
5. Push regularly (at least daily)
6. Create PRs with descriptive titles and descriptions
```

**Golden Rule:** Your commit message should explain **WHY**, not just what changed.

---

## üåø Branch Naming

### Format

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>

Types: feature | bug | refactor | docs
```

### Examples

**‚úÖ GOOD:**
```bash
feature/shareable-invite-links
bug/13-modal-closes-immediately
bug/14-project-not-in-dashboard
refactor/extract-permissions-hooks
docs/update-firebase-setup-guide
```

**‚ùå BAD:**
```bash
fix-stuff              # No type, vague
bug-fix                # No issue number, not specific
johns-branch           # Not descriptive
temp                   # No context
feature/PRD-0004       # Use description not PRD number
```

### Creating Branches

**From main:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```

**From existing feature:**
```bash
git checkout feature/parent-feature
git checkout -b feature/sub-feature-name
```

**üìö Junior Dev Note:**
Always branch from latest `main` unless you're building on someone else's feature (then branch from their branch).

### Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Feature:** | New functionality | Feature: Shareable invite links |
| **Fix:** | Bug fixes | Fix: Modal closes immediately |
| **Refactor:** | Code restructuring (no behavior change) | Refactor: Extract fetchProjects function |
| **Docs:** | Documentation only | Docs: Add Firebase email setup guide |
| **Test:** | Adding/fixing tests | Test: Add integration tests for invite flow |
| **Style:** | Formatting, no code change | Style: Fix ESLint warnings |
| **Chore:** | Build, dependencies, etc. | Chore: Update Firestore indexes config |

### Real Examples from This Session

**Example 1: Bug Fix (Bug #14)**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Fix: Projects not appearing in dashboard after invite acceptance

Root Cause:
- Projects were only fetched when currentUser changed (useEffect dependency)
- After accepting invite, currentUser hadn't changed
- onAccepted callback showed stale projects list without newly joined project
- User had to refresh browser to see the project

Solution:
- Extracted fetchProjects function using useCallback
- Called fetchProjects in onAccepted callback before navigating
- Projects list is now refreshed after invite acceptance
- User sees newly joined project immediately

Changes:
- src/App.jsx:
  - Added useCallback import
  - Extracted fetchProjects as useCallback (lines 53-89)
  - Updated useEffect to use extracted function (lines 91-93)
  - Updated onAccepted callback to refetch projects (lines 296-308)

Testing:
- All 648 tests passing
- ESLint clean
- Manual verification successful

Closes #16

)"
```

**Example 2: Feature Implementation**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Feature: Shareable invite links for project collaboration

Implemented PRD-0004:
- Generate shareable links with role and group selection
- Link management interface (view, revoke links)
- Accept invite flow with authentication
- Activity logging for link events
- Email notifications for invitations

Technical highlights:
- inviteLinkService for link generation and validation
- GenerateLinkModal component with role/group selection
- AcceptInviteLinkPage with token validation
- Firestore security rules for invite links collection
- Complete test coverage (648 tests passing)

Testing:
- All automated tests passing
- Manual testing completed per PRD acceptance criteria
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

Closes #10

```

**Example 3: Simple Fix**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Fix: Missing await in permission check causing infinite loading

Root Cause: Async function not awaited in useEffect

Solution: Added await keyword

### Commit Message Template

Use this helper for consistent formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<Type>: <One-line summary>

Root Cause (if bug fix):
- [Why it was broken]

Solution (or Description for features):
- [What you changed and why]

Changes:
- [File 1]: [What changed]
- [File 2]: [What changed]

Testing:
- [Test status]
- [Manual testing notes]

## ‚è∞ When to Commit

### ‚úÖ Commit when:
- Logical unit of work is complete (one feature, one fix, one refactor)
- ALL tests are passing (100%)
- ESLint is clean
- Code is reviewed (by you or Claude)
- You're about to switch context (end of day, etc.)

### ‚ùå Don't commit:
- Work in progress (broken code)
- Any failing tests
- Debugging code (console.log, commented code)
- Large multi-feature changes (break into smaller commits)
- Before reading the diff (always review what you're committing!)

### üìö Junior Dev Note:
Think of commits like save points in a video game. You want to save when you're in a good state, not in the middle of a boss fight!

---

## üì¶ Committing Workflow

### Step 1: Review Changes

```bash
git status
```

**Check:**
- [ ] All changed files intentional?
- [ ] No unintended files (node_modules, .env, etc.)?
- [ ] All intended changes included?

### Step 2: Review Diff

```bash
git diff
```

**Look for:**
- [ ] Debugging code left behind (console.log, debugger)
- [ ] Commented-out code that should be deleted
- [ ] TODO comments that should be addressed
- [ ] Accidental whitespace changes
- [ ] Code that doesn't match the commit purpose

### Step 3: Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# OR stage specific files
git add src/components/MyComponent.jsx
git add src/services/myService.js
```

**üìö Junior Dev Note:**
`git add -A` adds ALL changes (new, modified, deleted). Use it when you've reviewed everything. Use individual `git add` when you want to commit only specific files.

### Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
npm test
npx eslint .
```

**Must see:**
```
‚úÖ All tests passing
‚úÖ No ESLint errors
```

**If anything fails:** STOP. Fix it. Don't commit.

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Your commit message here]
EOF
)"
```

### Step 6: Push

```bash
# First time pushing branch
git push -u origin feature/your-branch-name

# Subsequent pushes
git push
```

---

## üîÑ Pull Requests

### Creating a PR

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh pr create --base main --head feature/your-branch-name

# Or via web interface
# Push branch first, then GitHub will show "Create PR" button
```

### PR Title Format

Same as commit message format:

```
<Type>: <One-line summary>

Examples:
Feature: Shareable invite links for project collaboration
Fix: Modal closes immediately after generating link
Refactor: Extract permissions hooks for reusability
```

### PR Description Template

```markdown

## üö´ Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Vague Commit Messages
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD
git commit -m "fixed bug"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "wip"
git commit -m "asdf"

# ‚úÖ GOOD
git commit -m "Fix: Modal closes before showing generated link"
```

**Why bad:** Future you won't know what was fixed or why

### Mistake #2: Massive Commits
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD: Changed 47 files
git commit -m "Added feature, fixed 3 bugs, refactored services, updated docs"

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Separate commits
git commit -m "Feature: Add invite link generation"
git commit -m "Fix: Modal closing issue"
git commit -m "Refactor: Extract permissions hooks"
git commit -m "Docs: Update setup guide"
```

**Why bad:** Hard to review, hard to revert, hard to understand

### Mistake #3: Committing Broken Code
```bash
$ npm test
‚ùå 1 failed | 647 passed

$ git commit -m "will fix tests later"  # ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
```

**Why bad:** Breaks CI/CD, blocks others, creates technical debt

### Mistake #4: Missing GitHub Issue Reference
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD
git commit -m "Fix: Bug with modal"

# ‚úÖ GOOD
git commit -m "Fix: Modal closes immediately

Closes #13"
```

**Why bad:** Can't track which commit fixed which issue

### Mistake #5: Not Using Heredoc for Multi-line
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD (hard to format, easy to mess up)
git commit -m "Fix: Bug
Root cause: callback timing
Solution: moved callback
Closes #13"

# ‚úÖ GOOD (proper formatting)
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Fix: Bug with modal

Root cause: callback timing
Solution: moved callback

Closes #13
EOF
)"
```
