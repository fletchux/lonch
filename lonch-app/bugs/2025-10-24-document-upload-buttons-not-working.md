# Bug Report: Document Upload Buttons Not Working

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**GitHub Issue:** #13
**Reporter:** User
**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** In Progress
**Branch:** `bug/13-document-upload-buttons-not-working`

---

## Description

On the Project Overview page, the "Project Documents" section displays two upload buttons - "Upload New Document" (shown when documents exist) and "Upload Your First Document" (shown in empty state). Neither button performs any action when clicked. This completely blocks users from uploading documents to their projects.

---

## Location

- **Page/View:** Project Overview page (Project Dashboard)
- **Component:** DocumentList component (bottom card)
- **URL/Route:** `/project/:projectId` (Overview tab)
- **Feature Area:** Document Management

---

## Expected Behavior

When a user clicks either "Upload New Document" or "Upload Your First Document" button:
1. A modal should appear containing the DocumentUpload component
2. User should be able to drag-and-drop or select files
3. Files should be uploaded to the project
4. The documents list should update to show the newly uploaded files

---

## Actual Behavior

When clicking either upload button, nothing happens. No modal appears, no error message is shown, and the user cannot upload documents.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to a project's Overview page
2. Scroll to the "Project Documents" section at the bottom
3. Click either "Upload New Document" button (top right) or "Upload Your First Document" button (in empty state)
4. Observe that nothing happens - no modal, no response

**Reproducibility:** Always

## Technical Details

### Error Messages
```
No console errors - the function is simply empty
```

### Root Cause (Identified)
**File:** `src/components/pages/ProjectDashboard.jsx:42-44`

The `handleUploadNew` function is a stub with only a TODO comment:
```javascript
const handleUploadNew = () => {
  // TODO: Show DocumentUpload component in a modal
};
```

This function is passed to DocumentList as the `onUploadNew` prop (line 282) and is called by both upload buttons (DocumentList.jsx lines 198 and 263), but it doesn't do anything.

### Environment
- **Browser:** All browsers
- **OS:** All operating systems
- **Device:** All devices

### Related Components
- **DocumentList.jsx** - Lines 198, 263 (calls onUploadNew)
- **ProjectDashboard.jsx** - Lines 42-44 (empty handler), line 282 (passes to DocumentList)
- **DocumentUpload.jsx** - Component exists but is never rendered

## Fix Plan

### Test-Driven Development Approach

- [ ] 1. Write failing test that reproduces the bug
- [ ] 2. Verify test fails (proves bug is captured)
- [ ] 3. Implement fix
- [ ] 4. Verify test passes
- [ ] 5. Run full test suite (check for regressions)
- [ ] 6. Manual verification
- [ ] 7. Update this report with root cause and solution

### Related Files

- `src/components/pages/ProjectDashboard.jsx` - Implement handleUploadNew function and modal state
- `src/components/pages/ProjectDashboard.test.jsx` - Add test for upload button functionality
- `src/components/documents/DocumentList.jsx` - Verify button behavior (no changes needed)

---

## Investigation Notes

### Root Cause Analysis

**Root Cause:**
The `handleUploadNew` function was never implemented. It was left as a TODO stub, which means the upload functionality was planned but never completed. The DocumentUpload component exists and is fully functional, but there's no way to display it from the ProjectDashboard.

**Why it wasn't caught:**
- [x] Missing test coverage - No test verifies that clicking the upload button opens a modal
- [ ] Edge case not considered
- [ ] Regression from recent change
- [ ] External dependency issue
- [x] Other: Feature incomplete - TODO left in production code

---

## Solution

### Required Implementation:

1. **Add modal state** to ProjectDashboard
   - State variable to track if upload modal is open
   - State to store uploaded files

2. **Implement handleUploadNew function**
   - Open the upload modal when called

3. **Add upload modal component** to ProjectDashboard JSX
   - Conditionally render modal based on state
   - Include DocumentUpload component inside modal
   - Handle file upload completion
   - Update project documents after upload

4. **Add document upload handler**
   - Process uploaded files
   - Save to Firestore
   - Update local state

### What was changed:
[To be filled in after implementation]

### Files modified:
- `src/components/pages/ProjectDashboard.jsx` - [What changed]
- `src/components/pages/ProjectDashboard.test.jsx` - [Tests added]

### Verification:
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing complete
- [ ] No regressions detected

---

## Prevention

- [x] Add test coverage for upload button click and modal display
- [x] Add integration test for full upload workflow
- [ ] Code review checklist: Verify no TODO comments in production code
- [ ] Update documentation about document upload flow

## Timeline

- **Reported:** 2025-10-24
- **Started:** TBD
- **Fixed:** TBD
- **Verified:** TBD
- **Deployed:** TBD

---

## Notes

This is a critical bug because it completely blocks document upload functionality, which is a core feature of the project management system. The good news is that the DocumentUpload component is already built and working - we just need to wire it up to the ProjectDashboard.
