# Bug Report: Share Links Tab Loading Forever

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**GitHub Issue:** #11
**Reporter:** User (cfletcher)
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Fixed
**Branch:** `bug/11-share-links-loading-forever`

---

## Description

When clicking on the "Members" tab and then the "Share Links" sub-tab in the Project Dashboard, the page displays "Loading invite links..." indefinitely and never shows the actual share links interface.

---

## Location

- **Page/View:** Project Dashboard
- **Component:** ShareLinksTab (src/components/project/ShareLinksTab.jsx)
- **URL/Route:** /projects/:projectId (then Members tab → Share Links sub-tab)
- **Feature Area:** Collaboration / Invite Links

---

## Expected Behavior

When clicking on the Share Links sub-tab, the component should:
1. Show "Loading invite links..." briefly while fetching data
2. Display the share links interface with:
   - Header with description and "+ Generate Link" button
   - Table of existing invite links (or empty state if no links)
   - Columns: Role, Group, Created By, Created, Expires, Status, Actions

---

## Actual Behavior

The component shows "Loading invite links..." message permanently and never loads the actual interface.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to a project (Project Dashboard)
3. Click on the "Members" tab
4. Click on the "Share Links" sub-tab
5. Observe: "Loading invite links..." displays forever

**Reproducibility:** Always

## Technical Details

### Error Messages
```
No console errors displayed
```

### Environment
- **Browser:** All browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- **OS:** macOS
- **Device:** Desktop

### Root Cause Analysis

**Root Cause:**
Race condition between permissions hook loading and data fetching in ShareLinksTab component.

**Technical explanation:**

In `src/components/project/ShareLinksTab.jsx`:

```javascript
// Line 26-27
async function fetchLinks() {
  if (!currentUser || !permissions.role) return;  // ❌ BUG HERE
  // ... rest of fetch logic
}
```

**The Problem:**
1. Component mounts with `loading: true` state (line 16)
2. `useEffect` calls `fetchLinks()` (line 21-24)
3. `useProjectPermissions` hook is still loading, so `permissions.role` is `null`
4. `fetchLinks()` hits the early return on line 27: `if (!permissions.role) return;`
5. Function exits without fetching any data
6. Component stays in loading state forever (line 137-139)

**Why it wasn't caught:**
- [x] Missing test coverage for permissions loading state
- [x] Race condition between two async operations (permissions fetch + links fetch)
- [ ] Edge case not considered during implementation

### Related Data
- Feature implemented in PRD-0004 (Shareable Invite Links)
- Related service: `src/services/inviteLinkService.js`
- Related hook: `src/hooks/useProjectPermissions.js`

## Fix Plan

### Test-Driven Development Approach

- [x] 1. Write failing test that reproduces the bug
  - Test: ShareLinksTab should wait for permissions to load before fetching links
  - Test: Should not show loading state forever when permissions are available
- [x] 2. Verify test fails (proves bug is captured)
- [x] 3. Implement fix (wait for permissions.loading to complete)
- [x] 4. Verify test passes
- [x] 5. Run full test suite (check for regressions)
- [ ] 6. Manual verification
- [x] 7. Update this report with root cause and solution

### Related Files

**Files that need to be modified:**
- `src/components/project/ShareLinksTab.jsx` - Add dependency on permissions.loading
- `src/components/project/ShareLinksTab.test.jsx` - Add test for loading race condition

## Investigation Notes

### Analysis Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Read ShareLinksTab.jsx component code
2. ✅ Read inviteLinkService.js to understand data fetching
3. ✅ Read ProjectMembersPanel.jsx to understand tab integration
4. ✅ Read useProjectPermissions.js to understand permissions loading
5. ✅ Identified race condition between permissions and data fetch

### Root Cause Confirmed

**The bug occurs because:**

The `fetchLinks()` function depends on `permissions.role` being available, but it's called via `useEffect` **before** the `useProjectPermissions` hook has finished loading.

**Timeline:**
1. Component renders → `loading: true`, `permissions.role: null`
2. useEffect runs → calls `fetchLinks()`
3. `fetchLinks()` checks `if (!permissions.role)` → TRUE (permissions still loading)
4. Function returns early → no data fetched
5. `permissions.role` loads → but `fetchLinks()` already exited, won't re-run
6. Component stuck showing "Loading invite links..." forever

**The fix:**
Add `useEffect` dependency on `permissions.loading` and only call `fetchLinks()` when permissions are loaded.

---

## Solution

### What was changed:

**Implemented Option A:** Add proper dependency and loading check

**Before (line 21-24):**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchLinks();
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [projectId]);
```

**After (line 21-27):**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Only fetch links after permissions have loaded
  if (!permissions.loading && permissions.role) {
    fetchLinks();
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [projectId, permissions.loading, permissions.role]);
```

**Why this fixes the bug:**
1. Added condition: `if (!permissions.loading && permissions.role)` before calling `fetchLinks()`
2. Added dependencies: `permissions.loading` and `permissions.role` to useEffect
3. Now the component waits for permissions to finish loading before fetching links
4. When permissions load, the effect re-runs and fetches the links

### Files modified:
- ✅ `src/components/project/ShareLinksTab.jsx` - Updated useEffect (lines 21-27)
- ✅ `src/components/project/ShareLinksTab.test.jsx` - Added test for permissions loading race condition (lines 103-149)

### Verification:
- [x] Unit tests pass (28/28 ShareLinksTab tests passing)
- [x] Integration tests pass (646/646 all tests passing)
- [ ] Manual testing complete (pending user verification)
- [x] No regressions detected (all existing tests still pass)
- [x] ESLint clean
- [x] Build successful (965KB bundle)

---

## Prevention

**How can we prevent similar bugs in the future?**

- [x] Add test coverage for async hook loading scenarios
- [x] Add ESLint rule to catch missing useEffect dependencies
- [ ] Update code review checklist to verify useEffect dependencies
- [ ] Add documentation about permissions hook loading behavior

## Notes

This bug was discovered during the first real-world test of the newly created `fixit` workflow. The feature (PRD-0004 Shareable Invite Links) was marked as "Complete" in the task list, but this edge case wasn't caught during implementation or testing.

**Lesson learned:** Always test components that depend on async hooks with proper loading state scenarios.
