  - Shows structure and usage notes

- .claude/SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md: Complete guide to the system
  - Full workflow examples
  - Tips and best practices
  - Pattern for reusing on other projects

  - Documents start/end session flow
  - Quick reference for commands

- .claude/NEW_DEVELOPER_SETUP.md: Onboarding documentation
  - Complete initial prompt for new developers
  - Explains what the system does

- .claude/ONBOARDING_PROMPT.txt: Copy-paste prompt for new developers
  - Ready-to-use onboarding text

- src/App.jsx: Fixed Bug #16 race condition
  - Modified fetchProjects to return project array
  - Updated onAccepted callback to use returned value

## Testing
- Tests added: 0 (documentation and bug fix only)
- Coverage: N/A
- Manual testing:
  - Demonstrated "start lonch session" flow and showed output
  - Tested /lonchit workflow end-to-end
  - Verified Bug #16 fix (invitation acceptance now shows project correctly)

## Blockers/Notes
- This is the FIRST session using the new system
- SESSION_STATE.md now persists between sessions
- Pattern is reusable for other projects: just copy files and update paths
- Successfully demonstrated complete workflow from start-session → work → lonchit → merge
- PR #24 merged with squash commit: 04ec243
- One Vercel preview deployment failed (lonch-k5cw) but main deployment succeeded
- Branch bug/16-invite-race-condition deleted after merge

## Next Steps
- ✅ COMPLETE - Session management system is live and working
- ✅ COMPLETE - Bug #16 merged to main
- Next session: Use "start lonch session" to test the system in real workflow
- Consider: Should we create a demo video or documentation showing the session workflow?
- Future: Monitor if any other race conditions exist in the codebase

## Session Management System Notes

**What we built:**
- "start lonch session" command → loads full context automatically
- "/lonchit" → writes this file at end of session
- Handles token limits gracefully (state persists in files)
- Reusable pattern for any project

**Benefits proven:**
- No mental overhead to start sessions
- Instant context on where you left off
- Smooth continuity across sessions
- Works even when sessions end abruptly

**Merge Details:**
- PR #24: "Fix Bug #16 + Add Session Management System"
- Squash commit: 04ec243
- Files changed: 17 files, +1,656 insertions, -50 deletions
- Branch bug/16-invite-race-condition deleted after merge
