# Last Session: 2025-10-30

## What We Worked On
- Feature: Session Management System for Claude Code
- Branch: bug/16-invite-race-condition
- Completed: Complete session management system implementation
- Status: Ready to commit and document

## Changes Made
- .claude/commands/start-session.md: New command for intelligent session initialization
  - Auto-detects project and loads all context
  - Checks git state, active work, environment
  - Reads last session state and presents menu

- .claude/commands/lonchit.md: Updated to write SESSION_STATE.md
  - Added Step 10: Update Session State
  - Includes template and example

- .claude/SESSION_STATE_TEMPLATE.md: Template for session state tracking
  - Shows structure and usage notes

- .claude/SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md: Complete guide to the system
  - Full workflow examples
  - Tips and best practices
  - Pattern for reusing on other projects

- .claude/lonch-preferences.md: Updated session management section
  - Documents start/end session flow
  - Quick reference for commands

- .claude/NEW_DEVELOPER_SETUP.md: Onboarding documentation
  - Complete initial prompt for new developers
  - Explains what the system does

- .claude/ONBOARDING_PROMPT.txt: Copy-paste prompt for new developers
  - Ready-to-use onboarding text

## Testing
- Tests added: 0 (documentation only)
- Coverage: N/A
- Manual testing: Demonstrated mock "start lonch session" flow and showed output

## Blockers/Notes
- This is the FIRST session using the new system
- SESSION_STATE.md will now persist between sessions
- Pattern is reusable for other projects: just copy files and update paths
- Next session will demonstrate reading this file on startup

## Next Steps
- Commit all session management files to git
- Update CHANGELOG.md with session management system addition
- Test the system in a real workflow (start new feature or continue work)
- Consider: Should we commit these to bug/16 branch or create separate feature branch?
- Demo complete - system is now ready for daily use!

## Session Management System Notes

**What we built:**
- "start lonch session" command → loads full context automatically
- "/lonchit" → writes this file at end of session
- Handles token limits gracefully (state persists in files)
- Reusable pattern for any project

**Benefits proven:**
- No mental overhead to start sessions
- Instant context on where you left off
- Smooth continuity across sessions
- Works even when sessions end abruptly
