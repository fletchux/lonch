## Architecture Decisions

### Cloud Storage
- Selected Firebase Storage for file storage
- Organized files by project-id/category/filename-timestamp structure
- Implemented retry logic for upload resilience

### AI Extraction
- LLM-based extraction using structured prompts
- JSON response format for structured data
- Fallback to partial extraction when some fields missing
- Conflict detection when multiple documents provide different values

### State Management
- Extended projectData with:
  - documents[] - uploaded files with metadata
  - extractedData - AI-extracted field values
  - extractionConflicts - conflicts from multiple sources
  - manuallyEditedFields[] - user-edited field tracking

### UI/UX
- Visual indicators for auto-populated fields
- Tooltips explaining data sources
- Conflict warnings with amber color coding
- Double-click confirmation for destructive actions
- Empty states throughout

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Testing Pending** (Tasks 7.13-7.14)
   - Real document testing requires production environment
   - LLM accuracy validation needs production API
   - Recommended before production release

2. **Production Configuration Required**
   - Cloud storage credentials need to be configured
   - LLM API keys need to be added
   - Environment-specific settings required

3. **Extraction Accuracy**
   - 50% accuracy threshold has not been validated with real documents
   - Depends on LLM model and prompt tuning
   - May require iteration with production data

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Configure Firebase Storage credentials
- [ ] Add LLM API keys (OpenAI, Claude, or other)
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Test with real contract documents
- [ ] Validate extraction accuracy (target: >50%)
- [ ] Test file upload with large files (>10MB)
- [ ] Verify retry logic with poor network conditions
- [ ] Test admin access control with real user roles
- [ ] Review cloud storage costs and quotas
- [ ] Set up monitoring for extraction failures
