# Getting Started - Development Workflow

This guide walks you through the complete development workflow for starting a new feature.

## Prerequisites

- Git configured and authenticated
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Test coverage package installed (`@vitest/coverage-v8`)

## Quick Start: The "shazam" Command

**Want to skip the manual steps?** Use the automated workflow:

```bash
resume      # Check project state
/shazam     # üöÄ Automates steps 2-6 below!
```

The `shazam` command will:
1. ‚úÖ Check you're on main with clean state
2. ‚úÖ Pull latest changes
3. ‚úÖ Walk you through creating a PRD
4. ‚úÖ Generate tasks with TDD structure
5. ‚úÖ Create GitHub issue automatically
6. ‚úÖ Create feature branch
7. ‚úÖ Mark issue as in-progress
8. ‚úÖ Ready to code with `/process-task-list`

**Result:** From idea to ready-to-code in one command!

Then continue with step 7 (Process Tasks) below.

---

## Complete Workflow: From Idea to Production (Manual Steps)

**Note:** Use `/shazam` to automate steps 2-6, or follow manually below:

### 1. Start Your Session

```bash
resume
```

**What this does:**
- Shows recent git commits
- Displays current branch and status
- Helps you understand where you left off

**Expected output:**
```
Recent commits: ...
Current branch: main
Status: clean
```

### 2. Ensure Clean State

```bash
# Verify you're on main branch
git status

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Check for existing issues (avoid duplicates)
gh issue list
```

### 3. Create PRD (Product Requirements Document)

```bash
/create-prd
```

**What this does:**
- Claude asks clarifying questions about your feature
- You answer to help define requirements
- PRD is generated in `/tasks/XXXX-prd-feature-name.md`

**Example interaction:**
```
Claude: "What problem does this feature solve?"
You: "Users need to export their data to CSV"

Claude: "What are the key user stories?"
You: "As a user, I want to download my data as CSV so I can analyze it offline"

[PRD is generated and saved]
```

**Output file:** `tasks/0006-prd-data-export.md`

### 4. Generate Tasks from PRD

```bash
/generate-tasks
```

**What this does:**
- Claude reads the PRD
- Analyzes existing codebase
- Generates high-level parent tasks
- Waits for your approval
- You say "Go"
- Claude generates detailed sub-tasks with TDD structure
- **Automatically creates GitHub issue**

**Example interaction:**
```
Claude: "I have generated the high-level tasks:
1.0 Create export service
2.0 Build UI components
3.0 Add API endpoints
4.0 Testing & validation

Ready to generate sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."

You: "Go"

Claude: [Generates detailed sub-tasks with tests]
Claude: "GitHub issue #45 created: PRD-0006: Data Export"
```

**Output files:**
- `tasks/tasks-0006-prd-data-export.md`
- GitHub Issue #45 created

### 5. Create Feature Branch

**IMPORTANT:** Use the issue number from step 4!

```bash
# Option 1: Feature branch with issue number
git checkout -b feature/45-data-export

# Option 2: PRD-based branch
git checkout -b prd/0006-data-export
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/123-description` - New feature with issue number
- `fix/123-description` - Bug fix with issue number
- `prd/XXXX-description` - PRD-based work
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### 6. Mark Issue as In Progress

```bash
gh issue edit 45 --add-label "in-progress"

gh issue comment 45 --body "üöÄ Started implementation

**Branch:** feature/45-data-export
**Following TDD:** Tests before implementation
**Next:** Task 1.0 - Create export service"
```

### 7. Process Tasks (TDD Implementation)

```bash
/process-task-list
```

**What this does:**
- Claude finds the task list for current PRD
- Implements each sub-task following TDD:
  1. Write test(s) first
  2. Run test (should FAIL - RED)
  3. Implement feature
  4. Run test (should PASS - GREEN)
  5. Refactor if needed
  6. Mark sub-task complete

**Important:** Claude will:
- Ask permission before starting each sub-task
- Wait for you to say "yes" or "y" before proceeding
- Run tests before marking tasks complete
- Commit when all sub-tasks in a parent task are done

**Your role:**
- Review the code before saying "yes"
- Provide feedback if needed
- Approve moving to next sub-task

### 8. Monitor Progress

While working, you can:

```bash
# Check test status
npm test

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage

# View task list progress
cat tasks/tasks-0006-prd-data-export.md

# Check issue status
gh issue view 45
```

### 9. Complete Feature - "lonchit"

When all tasks are done:

```bash
lonchit
```

**What this does (in order):**

1. **Quality Checks:**
   - Run full test suite
   - Run linter
   - Run build
   - Check test coverage (>80%)

2. **Self-Review:**
   - Review git diff
   - Check for sensitive data
   - Verify error handling
   - Ensure all tests exist

3. **Security & Performance:**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Input validation in place
   - No console.logs with sensitive data

4. **Clean Up:**
   - Remove debug code
   - Remove TODO comments
   - Remove unused imports

5. **Documentation:**
   - Add/update JSDoc comments
   - Update README if needed
   - Document env variables

6. **Git Commit:**
   - Create descriptive commit message
   - Include issue reference (#45)
   - Include test coverage info

7. **Update GitHub Issue:**
   - Add completion summary
   - Update labels

8. **Documentation:**
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update feature docs

9. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push branch to origin

10. **Summary Report:**
    - Shows what was done
    - Suggests next steps

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ lonchit Complete!

## TDD Workflow (During /process-task-list)

For each sub-task:

```bash
# 1. Write test first
# Claude creates: src/services/exportService.test.js

# 2. Run test (should FAIL)
npm test -- src/services/exportService.test.js
# ‚ùå FAIL - function doesn't exist yet (RED)

# 3. Implement feature
# Claude creates: src/services/exportService.js

# 4. Run test (should PASS)
npm test -- src/services/exportService.test.js
# ‚úÖ PASS (GREEN)

# 5. Refactor if needed
# Improve code while tests protect you

# 6. Mark complete
# Claude marks sub-task [x] in task list
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No PRD found"
- Make sure you ran `/create-prd` first
- Check that PRD file exists in `/tasks/` directory

### "Task list already exists"
- You may have already run `/generate-tasks` for this PRD
- Check `/tasks/tasks-XXXX-prd-name.md` exists

### "Tests failing during lonchit"
- STOP - do not proceed with lonchit
- Fix failing tests first
- Run `npm test` to see failures
- Fix and re-run until all pass

### "Coverage too low"
- Add more tests for new code
- Aim for >80% coverage on new code
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to see report

### "Branch conflicts"
- You may be behind main
- Run `git fetch && git status`
- If behind: `git pull --rebase origin main`
- Resolve conflicts and continue

### "Issue not created"
- Check GitHub CLI auth: `gh auth status`
- May need additional scopes: `gh auth refresh`
- Manually create issue if needed:
  ```bash
  gh issue create --title "PRD-XXXX: Feature Name" \
    --body "$(cat tasks/XXXX-prd-name.md)" \
    --label "feature,prd-XXXX"
  ```

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Always start with `resume` to check state
- Pull latest before creating new branch
- Follow TDD: tests before implementation
- Review each sub-task before approving
- Run tests frequently during development
- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Reference issue numbers in commits (#45)
- Update issue with progress comments

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Skip writing tests first (breaks TDD)
- Commit without tests passing
- Push with failing tests or linting errors
- Commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Start new feature without syncing main
- Work on main branch directly
- Skip the lonchit checklist steps

## Next Steps

Now you're ready to build features using this workflow!

1. Try it with a small feature first
2. Get comfortable with the TDD cycle
3. Use the GitHub integration to track progress
4. Iterate and improve your process

**Remember:** The workflow is designed to ensure quality, not slow you down. Following TDD and the quality checks will save you debugging time later!
